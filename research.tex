\section{Introduction}
In this article, I discuss the definition of five quality attributes and different ways of measuring them. I use the
ISO/IEC 25010:2011\footnote{\label{iso}https://www.iso.org/standard/35733.html} as a reference.

\section{Performance efficiency}
The performance of a system is how the system performs relative to the amount of resources it is given
under stated conditions. It can be measured using the time behavior of the system, its resource utilization and its
capacity\footnote{See footnote \ref{iso}}. I discuss the first two.

\subsection{Resource utilization}

\subsubsection{Response time}
Having requested a task from a system, the response time is determined by measuring
the amount of time it takes to produce the first output of this task.

\subsubsection{Processing time}
Having requested a task from a system, the processing time is determined by measuring
the amount of time from start to finish of that
task\footnote{https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/processing-time}.

\subsubsection{Throughput}
Throughput is the number of transaction/tasks that a system can handle per unit
time\footnote{https://testguild.com/performance-testing-what-is-throughput/}

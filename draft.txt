Performance efficiency
    - Time behavior
        - Response time
            - The time taken till the first output is produced
        - Processing time
            - https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/processing-time
            - The time taken for a procedure from start to finish
        - Throughput
            - https://testguild.com/performance-testing-what-is-throughput/
            - The number of transactions the system can handle per unit time
    - Resource utilization
        - The amount of resources used by the system when performing its functions
            - Used memory
            - Used network bandwidth
            - Percentage of CPU utilization
    - All of the previous are divided by their respective numbers in the requirements

Reliability
    - Availability
        - Degree to which a system or part of a system is available for use when required
        - Calculating by dividing the uptime over the total time the system was expected to be available (uptime + downtime)
        - https://www.fiixsoftware.com/glossary/system-availability/
    - Fault tolerance
        - Degree to which a system can operate under hardware or software failures
        - The number of subsystem failures that can be tolerated / the number of available subsystems
        - http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~leparker/publications/PERMIS_06.pdf
    - Recoverability
        - The degree to which a system can recover data and re-establish its state after a failure


Security

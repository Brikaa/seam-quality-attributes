Performance efficiency
    - Time behavior
        - Response time
            - The time taken till the first output is produced
        - Processing time
            - https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/processing-time

        - Throughput
            - https://testguild.com/performance-testing-what-is-throughput/
            - The number of transactions the system can handle per unit time
    - Resource utilization
        - The amount of resources used by the system when performing its functions
            - Used memory
            - Used network bandwidth
            - Percentage of CPU utilization
    - All of the previous are divided by their respective numbers in the requirements

Reliability
    - The degree to which a system performs specified functions under specified conditions for a specified period of time
    - Availability
        - Degree to which a system or part of a system is available for use when required
        - Calculating by dividing the uptime over the total time the system was expected to be available (uptime + downtime)
        - https://www.fiixsoftware.com/glossary/system-availability/
    - Fault tolerance
        - Degree to which a system can operate under hardware or software failures
        - The number of subsystem failures that can be tolerated / the number of available subsystems
        - http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~leparker/publications/PERMIS_06.pdf
    - Recoverability
        - The degree to which a system can recover data and re-establish its state after a failure
        - Recovery time = avg(incident resolved timestamp - incident reported timestamp)
        - https://blog.codacy.com/how-to-measure-time-to-recover/

Usability
    - The degree to which a specific system can be by specified users used with
        effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction to achieve a certain goal in a specific context
    - Learnability
        - The degree to which the user finds it easy to achieve a specific task on the system for the first time and
            how many repetitions it takes the user to become efficient at that task.
        - https://www.nngroup.com/articles/measure-learnability
        - First time learnability: the amount of time it takes the user to do a certain task on the system for the first time
        - Learning curve
            - Number of repetitions on x-axis
            - Time on y-axis
            - A curve that falls faster indicates faster learnability
        - Efficiency: after reaching a plateau on the learning curve, how much time does it take the user to perform the
            task (how long does it take an expert at the system to perform the task)
    - Accessibility
        - degree to which a system can be used by people with the widest range of characteristics
        - Multiple standards exist
        - Web Content Accessibility Guidelines is an international set of accessibility standards
        - https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-principles/
        - Perceivability: the degree to which all users can perceive all essential information on the screen
            - Text alternatives for non-text content (as images)
            - Captions for multimedia content
            - Color is not the only way to convey meaning
        - Operability: the degree to which it is possible for the user can operate the system's interface
            - Functionality is available from a keyboard?
            - Functionality is available from a touchscreen?
            - Functionality is available form voice assistants?
        - Understandability: the degree to which the users are able to understand the information on the system and the
            operation of the user interface
        - Robustness: the degree to which the system is accessible on different agents and devices
            - Newest browsers?
            - Old browsers?
            - Newest devices?
            - Old devices?
            - Different device orientations?

Maintainability
    - The degree of effectiveness and efficiency with which a system can be modified by intended maintainers
    - Modularity
        - the degree to which a system is composed of independent components such that a change in one component
            has minimal change on another
        - valid_dependencies / total_dependencies
        - https://medium.com/ro-engineering-blog/measuring-modularity-45abe4297896
    - Testability
        - The degree of effectiveness and efficiency with which test criteria can be formulated for a system or component
            and tests can be performed to determine whether these criteria have been met
        - Testable components: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_testability

Security
    - The degree to which the system protects data and information so that users or other systems have the degree of data
        access that is appropriate to their role
    - Fatal if a data item fails to satisfy any of the following measures
    - Confidentiality
        - The degree to which the system ensures that data is accessible to only those who are authorized
            to access it
    - Integrity
        - The degree to which the system prevents unauthorized access or modification to data or code
    - Non-repudiation
        - The existence of a proof of an event so that it can not be repudiated later.
    - Accountability
        - The degree to which all actions of an entity can be traced back to that entity
    - Authenticity
